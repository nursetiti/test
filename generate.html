         <p>THE TYPES OF POVERTY ARE</p>
			<p><ul>1.SITUATIONAL POVERTY</p>
				<p>This particular type of poverty is usually temporary as it involves a crisis or loss occurring.
					 Events connected with situational poverty include environmental disasters, divorce, 
					 or severe health problems. A good example of situational poverty caused by an environmental
					  disaster would be the destruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Many people were 
					  homeless, lost their jobs, and had nothing to their name.
					 The fall of the economy can also be considered an event that could cause situational poverty.</p>
				</ul>
					 <p><ul>2.GENERATIONAL POVERTY</p>
					 <p>his type of poverty involves the birth of two generations into poverty. Because they were
						  born
						  into this situation, they usually don’t have the tools to help get themselves out of it..</p>
					 </ul>
						   <p><ul>3.ABSOLUTE POVERTY</p>
					 <p>his particular type of poverty is actually rare in the United States. People in absolute poverty don’t even have basic necessities lik
						 a roof over their head, food, and water. Their only focus is on surviving each day as it comes..</p>
					 </ul>
						 <p><ul>4.RELATIVE POVERTY</p>
						 <p>This type of poverty is known as relative because it is relative to
							  the average standard of living in that person’s society. What is 
							  considered high income in one country could be considered middle or low income in another. If a family’s income isn’t enough to meet the average standard of living, they are considered to be in relative poverty.
