	no 26 abiye street iwaya yaba lagos.i want to become a programmer and also a lawyer i want to change the negative
	 things to positive things in my environment,most especially the case of poverty and fulfilling all those things is what am based on.
	 I believe that even if one cant stop something from happening at the least the  person can reduce it now applying
	 that to poverty even if i cant stop it but i believe i will stop it ,then i can reduce it because merely the pain 
	 people are going through they can give up but then asking myself what can make people  encouraged then i wrote this 
	 project then saying possible solutions and i believe that if all those solutions are adhered to poverty will decrease 
	 tremendously
