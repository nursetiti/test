	  </ul>
		   <p><ul>2.HOUSING CONDITION</p>
		   <p>The housing condition of majority of poor is very bad. Due to the large family size, there is always over crowing in house hold. All family members have to live in a limited space and without electricity and other physical facilities..</p>
		   </ul>
				 <p><ul>3.LOWER EDUCATIONAL STATUS</p>
		   <p>Majority of poor are illiterate. High illiteracy rate is either due to ignorance or poverty or both. They canâ€™t get educational opportunity and they are not capable to provide education to their children..</p>
		   </ul>
			   <p><ul>4.OCCUPATION</p>
			   <p>The occupation of the poor is generally agriculture. Majority of the poor people do not have their own land. They are compelled to do work at low wage rate. Their income is always insufficient for their subsistence. So, some poor become beggars, garbage shifters, prostitutes etc.</p>
