				<h1>POVERTY</h1>
		<p>Lacking  financial requirements for one's upkeep that is poverty .People require assistance financially to
			 survive their are lots of reasons why people get financially challenged,some of the reasons are:fire outbreak
			  resulting in loss of lives and properties,flood,loss of jobs.children especially are affected .nigeria has 
			  one of the world's highest economic  growth.</p>
			</article>
			<p>THE EFFECTS OF POVERTY ARE :</p> 
	  <p><ul>1.EDUCATION</p>
	  <p>Poor children typically go to rundown schools with inadequate facilities where 
		  they receive inadequate schooling. They are much less likely than wealthier children 
		  to graduate from high school or to go to college. Their lack of education in turn restricts 
		  them and their own children to poverty,
		   once again helping to ensure a vicious cycle of continuing poverty across generations.</p>
	  </ul>
		   <p><ul>2.HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS</p>
		   <p>The poor are, not surprisingly, more likely to be homeless than the nonpoor but also more
				likely to live in dilapidated housing and unable to buy their own homes. Many poor families
				 spend more than half their income on rent, and they tend to live in poor neighborhoods that
				 ack job opportunities,
				 good schools, and other features of modern life that wealthier people take for granted.</p>
		   </ul>
				 <p><ul>3.HEALTH ILLNESS AND MEDICAL CARE</p>
		   <p>The poor are also more likely to have many kinds of health problems, including infant mortality
			   , earlier adulthood mortality, and mental illness, and they are also more likely to receive
			   
			   inadequate medical care. Poor children are more likely to have inadequate nutrition and, 
			   partly for this reason, to suffer health, behavioral, and cognitive problems. 
			   These problems in turn impair their ability to do well in school and land stable
			    employment as adults, helping to ensure that poverty will persist across generations</p>
		   </ul>
			   <p><ul>4.FAMILY PROBLEMS</p>
			   <p>Even in families that are not poor, running a household can cause stress, children can
					cause stress, and paying the bills can cause stress. Families that are poor have more stress
					ecause of their poverty,
				    and the ordinary stresses of family life become even more intense in poor families. </p>
</ul>
