            <p>1.changing trends in a countryâ€™s economy, lack of education, high divorce rate which causes feminization of poverty, having a culture of poverty, overpopulation, epidemic diseases such as AIDS and malaria,[1] and environmental problems such as lack of rainfall and others</p> 
 
            <p>2.corruption:Corruption is the abuse of public resources or public power for personal gain. Corruption Watch is concerned with any such abuse by anyone at any level of government or in business.</p>
            
            
              <p>3.mental illness:People with mental illness often live in chronic poverty. Conversely, poverty can be a significant risk factor for poor physical and mental health.</p>
            
            
            <p>4.world hunger:Poverty causes hunger. Not every poor person is hungry, but almost all hungry people are poor. Millions live with hunger and malnourishment because they simply cannot afford to buy enough food, cannot afford nutritious foods or cannot afford the farming supplies they need to grow enough good food of their own</p>
             
            
            <p>5.epidemic disease:Overcrowded and poor living conditions can contribute to the spread of airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and respiratory infections such as pneumonia. Reliance on open fires or traditional stoves can lead to deadly indoor air pollution. A lack of food, clean water and sanitation can also be fatal.</p>
              
            
           <p>6.Unemployment:Among the factors that often contribute to poverty are unemployment and underemployment. Put simply, many people live in poverty because they are unable to find a job that pays a living wage or to find a job at all.And that is why they  are tempted to beg</p>
              
           <p>7.Overpopulation:When the country is overpopulated there will be an high rate of poverty,and the people will be seen begging on the street</p>
           
         <p>8.lack of access to education:Lack of education is root cause of poverty. When one is not educated and is not business wise that may result in poverty and people may even disregard such person</p>
