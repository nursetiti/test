           <h1>THE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO POVERTY ARE AS FOLLOWS</h1> 
				   
                   <p>1.Having access to education is a way of escaping poverty.How is this possible? When you are educated you 
					   get particular skills and potential power for earning money,now  if you specialize in a particular
					    field, it will increase your ability to earn money.</p>

                   <p>2.Creating job opportunities:when everyone has a job,even if it is not a white collar job and everyone is well to do,poverty will decrease tremendously.</p>
                    
                    <p>3.If corruption is also stoped poverty will reduce because if the people into polictics should be the one making use of the resources and spending the country's money,they wont be enough left for the citizen theby resulting in poverty.</p>
                    
                   <p>4.learning a trade or vocational skill:when one learns a trade it can help earn a good life even when you are not educated and learn tailoring, hairdressing etc all these vocation are in hot demand, people want to make their hair,sew their dress,repair their car etc so one can live a life worth living.</p>
                    
                    <p>5.Helping farmers:Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three quarters of the poor today are farmers.If farmers are given sufficient farm tools to plant poverty will reduce.Improving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming.</p>
                    
                    <p>6.Income equality:There are more rural poor than urban poor and they are given different access to infrastructure and social amenities and that is why poverty is common in the rural area.so if people living in the rural area are treated the same way as those in urban area poverty will also decrease.</p>
